# Solidity Interview Questions: Advanced Level

1. Explain the delegatecall vulnerability and how it can be mitigated.
* Answer: Delegatecall vulnerability occurs when a contract blindly delegates a call to another contract, potentially leading to unintended behavior. To mitigate, use call with limited gas and avoid passing untrusted data.

2. Describe how the Ethereum gas mechanism works.
* Answer: Gas measures the computational work needed to execute a transaction or contract. Users pay gas fees to incentivize miners to include their transactions in blocks. Gas prices can fluctuate based on network demand.

3. What is a reentrancy attack? How can it be prevented?
* Answer: Reentrancy attack occurs when a contract repeatedly calls itself during the execution of an external call, leading to unexpected behavior. Prevent it by using checks-effects-interactions pattern and applying mutex-like mechanisms.

4. How does the ERC-20 token standard work?
* Answer: The ERC-20 standard defines a set of functions and events that a token contract must implement to enable compatibility and interaction with other contracts and services.

5. Explain the purpose of the assembly block in Solidity.
* Answer: The assembly block provides low-level access to Ethereum's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) operations, allowing developers to write highly optimized and specialized code.

6. What are proxy contracts and why are they useful?
* Answer: Proxy contracts act as intermediaries, allowing you to upgrade a contract's logic without changing its address. They are useful for maintaining upgradable contracts while preserving user interactions.

7. Describe the differences between a private blockchain and the Ethereum mainnet.
* Answer: A private blockchain is restricted in terms of participants and is often used for testing or internal purposes. The Ethereum mainnet is the public, decentralized network where real transactions occur.

8. What is a flash loan and how does it work?
* Answer: A flash loan is a type of uncollateralized loan in DeFi platforms. The borrower must repay the loan within the same transaction, preventing misuse. It exploits the atomicity of Ethereum transactions.

9. How does Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2) differ from Ethereum 1.0 (Eth1)?
* Answer: Ethereum 2.0 introduces a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, shard chains for scalability, and various protocol upgrades to enhance network efficiency and security.

10. Explain the concept of on-chain and off-chain data in the context of Solidity.
* Answer: On-chain data is stored directly on the blockchain, accessible to all nodes. Off-chain data is stored outside the blockchain, often in centralized or decentralized databases, and may require additional verification for reliability.
