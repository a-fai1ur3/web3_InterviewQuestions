# Solidity Interview Questions: Beginner Level

1. What is Solidity?
* Answer: Solidity is a high-level programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. What is a Smart Contract?
* Answer: A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It automatically enforces and executes the agreement when predefined conditions are met.

3. What is the purpose of the pragma solidity statement?
* Answer: The pragma solidity statement is used to specify the version of the Solidity compiler that should be used to compile the contract. It ensures compatibility and proper compilation.

4. What is a data type in Solidity?
* Answer: A data type specifies the type of value that a variable can hold. Solidity supports various data types including uint, string, address, bool, etc.

5. How do you define a state variable in Solidity?
* Answer: State variables are declared at the contract level and hold data that persists across function calls. They are defined using the syntax: uint256 public myVariable;.

6. What is the purpose of a constructor in Solidity?
* Answer: A constructor is a special function called only once when a contract is deployed. It initializes contract data and performs setup operations.

7. Explain the visibility specifiers: public, internal, external, and private.
* Answer: These specifiers control the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions. public makes them accessible from any context, internal restricts access to the contract and derived contracts, external is for external function calls, and private limits access to the current contract.

8. How is function overloading achieved in Solidity?
* Answer: Function overloading is not supported in Solidity. However, you can achieve similar behavior using different function names.

9. What is an event in Solidity?
* Answer: An event is a way to log and notify external applications about specific actions that occur within a smart contract. Events provide a historical record of contract interactions.

10. How is error handling typically done in Solidity?
* Answer: Solidity uses the revert function to handle errors. It's common to use conditional statements to check conditions and revert the transaction if necessary.
